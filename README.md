A simple linear algebra program that can do most matrix operations. Matrix class is currently implemented as a linear array but may change to using `**matrix` to store elements. Currently a WIP.

TODO:
- Determinant formula
- Write matInv() function that inverts the matrix based on the correct conditions
- Create a rref() function
- Return the 4 subspaces of the matrix
